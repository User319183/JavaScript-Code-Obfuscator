        <h2>About JSfuscator</h2>
        <p>JSfuscator is a web service that performs obfuscation techniques on JavaScript files. It's currently free to
            use.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>Our service offers a variety of obfuscation techniques, including variable renaming, string encoding, and
            control flow flattening. You can customize the obfuscation settings to suit your needs.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>JSfuscator parses your JavaScript code into an abstract syntax tree (AST), applies obfuscation techniques to
            the AST, and then generates the obfuscated code from the modified AST.</p>

        <h2>Usage Instructions</h2>
        <p>To use our service, simply paste your JavaScript code into the input box, customize the obfuscation settings
            if desired, and click the "Obfuscate" button. Your obfuscated code will be displayed in the output box.</p>

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>JSfuscator was born out of a desire to empower developers with a robust, free tool to protect their
            JavaScript code from reverse engineering. While obfuscation isn't a silver bullet for security, it
            significantly raises the bar for anyone trying to decipher your code.</p>

        <p>We envisioned JSfuscator as a free, closed-source alternative to other services like Obfuscator.io. Unlike
            many other tools, JSfuscator doesn't rely on cracked or paid public algorithms. Our commitment to keeping
            JSfuscator free is unwavering, which is why we've chosen not to open-source it. Our journey doesn't stop
            here. We're continually innovating and have exciting plans for the future, including
            a Discord bot version of JSfuscator. Stay tuned!</p>
