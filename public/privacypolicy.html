        <h3>Respecting Your Privacy</h3>
        <p>JSfuscator respects your privacy. When you send a file to JSfuscator, it's processed for obfuscation and then
            immediately deleted from our servers. However, we do store a copy of the obfuscated code in our database for
            the purpose of improving our service. We don't share your files with any third parties.</p>

        <h3>Data Collection</h3>
        <p>We collect IP addresses and user-agent information for security purposes, such as detecting and preventing
            abuse. We also log if a VPN is used. By using JSfuscator, you consent to this collection. We do not use this
            information for any other purpose and we do not share it with third parties.</p>
