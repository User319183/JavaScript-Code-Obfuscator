# JSfuscator 🔒 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for JSfuscator! JSfuscator is a robust, free-to-use JavaScript obfuscator that helps protect your JavaScript code from reverse engineering. 🔎 💻

We are excited to announce that we have open-sourced JSfuscator v1! To get started, copy the contents of the [`.env.example`](.env.example) file to a new file named `.env` and replace the placeholders with your actual values.

## Why JSfuscator? ❓

In the world of web development, JavaScript is everywhere. But with its ubiquity comes the risk of your code being stolen or tampered with. That's where JSfuscator comes in. 🛡️

JSfuscator uses advanced obfuscation techniques to transform your JavaScript into a form that's functionally identical to the original, but much harder for humans (and machines) to understand. 🧠 🤖

## Future Plans 🔮

We're continually innovating and have exciting plans for the future. We are currently working on JSfuscator v2, a complete rewrite of the obfuscator. This version will be closed-source and will include many improvements and new features. For more information, check out the [v2 README](v2/README.md). Stay tuned! 📺
