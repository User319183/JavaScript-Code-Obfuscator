# JSfuscator v2

We are excited to announce that we are currently working on JSfuscator v2. The first version of JSfuscator was a great success, but we realized that there were areas where we could improve and optimize. This led us to the decision to release v1 and start working on a complete rewrite for v2.

The upcoming version, JSfuscator v2, is a result of our continuous commitment to provide a more efficient, robust, and user-friendly JavaScript obfuscation tool. We are taking into account all the feedback we received from v1 and incorporating it into the new version.

We are working diligently on this rewrite and we are confident that it will be worth the wait. Stay tuned for the release of JSfuscator v2, coming out shortly!
